### Data Wrangling

## Loading data
# Import NOCVR shape file in US
NCOVRshp <- st_read("ncovr/NAT.shp")
# 3085 columns of 69 variables, CRS: WGS 84

# Import boundaries for STATE.shp in US
STATE <- st_read("cb_2018_us_state_500k/cb_2018_us_state_500k.shp") # Geodetic CRS:  NAD83
# Transform CRS to WGS 84
STATEshp <- STATE %>%
  st_transform(.,4326)


## Make a map
# Generate an empty map to visualize the spatial configuration and hierarchy of US
# First add Counties layer 
US <- tm_shape(NCOVRshp) + tm_polygons() +
  # Add States layer on top of Counties layer and make it transparent with alpha = 0
  tm_shape(STATEshp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.alpha = 1, border.col = "black") +
  # Apply cosmetics by adding compass and scale
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) + tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom"))

## Fitting a non-spatial Linear Regression on spatial data and check the residuals

# lm() function builds a regression model and stores model output into the object 'fit_1'
# Since there are variables with negative value, log10() cannot be used to transform data:
# fit_1 <- lm(log10(HR90) ~ log10(RD90) + log10(DV90) + log10(MA90) + log10(PS90) + log10(UE90), data = NCOVRshp)
fit_1 <- lm(HR90 ~ RD90 + DV90 + MA90 + PS90 + UE90, data = NCOVRshp)

# An element of this object then includes the residual for each of the observations
summary(fit_1)
# Adjusted R square = 0.4173 , p-value < 2.2e-16

# Extract residuals from "fit_1" object and dump into "NCOVRshp" and call the column "res_fit1"
NCOVRshp$res_fit1 <- residuals(fit_1)
# if the residual is negative, then the observed value is lower than the predicted 
# (that is, the model is overpredicting the level of homicide for that observation) 
# if the residual is positive, then the observed value is higher than the predicted 
# (that is, the model is underpredicting the level of homicide for that observation).

# Extract the predicted values
NCOVRshp$fitted_fit1 <- fitted(fit_1)

# Since if we assume normal distribution of residuals, 
# then 68% of all counties should lie within the middle band from -1 to +1 s.d.
# From the plot, we can roughly conclude that the residuals exhibit a normal distribution
# And the spatial patterning of blue areas are over-prediction and red areas are under-prediction
# This visual inspection of the residuals shows that spatial autocorrelation may be present here. 
# Therefore,we would require a more formal test.


## Confirm the presence of spatial autocorrelation -- Moranâ€™s I test

# generate unique number for each row
NCOVRshp$ROWNUM <- 1:nrow(NCOVRshp)
# coerce the sf object into a new sp object
NCOVR_sp <- as(NCOVRshp, "Spatial")
# Create spatial weights matrix for areas

WeightsMatrix <- nb2mat(Weights, style='B')
Residual_WeightMatrix <- mat2listw(WeightsMatrix , style='W')

# Run the test on the linear regression model output object "fit_1" using lm.morantest()
lm.morantest(fit_1, Residual_WeightMatrix, alternative="two.sided")
# we obtained a statistically significant value (i.e., p-value < 0.001) for Moranâ€™s I of value = 0.1301782844. 
# The value of the Moranâ€™s I test is not too high. 
# However, we still need keep in mind that if the residuals exist spatial autocorrelation (the residuals are re somewhat related to each other and thus not independent)
# Therefore, A spatial regression would be much appropriate for modelling this type of data since thereâ€™s evidence of spatial autocorrelation.


### Spatial Regression Model

## Spatial Lag Model on the dependent variable
# we assume that the the homicide rate in one county is impacted by the homicide rate from nearby neighbouring counties
# Fit model using lagsarlm()
# reuse spatial weight matrix created earlier as an object called "Residual_WeighMatrix" 
fit_2_lag <- lagsarlm(HR90 ~ RD90 + DV90 + MA90 + PS90 + UE90, data = NCOVR_sp, Residual_WeightMatrix)

# Report results with summary()
summary(fit_2_lag)
# The pho = 0.25948 informs us of how the neighbouring counties' homicide rates affect the homicide rate at y.
# pho value is positive, which means the neighbouring counties affect is a positive manner, and it is statistically significant (i.e., p-value < 0.001). 
# We can see the AIC for the lag model is lower than the original linear regression model (i.e., Lag: 18636 vs LM: 18778) therefore the lag model is okay.

# extract the residuals for fit_2_lag object and dump back to original sf NCOVRshp object
NCOVRshp$res_fit2_lag <- fit_2_lag$residuals

# express the residuals in terms of standard deviations away from the mean. (RESID_SLY)
NCOVRshp$RESID_SLY <- (NCOVRshp$res_fit2_lag - mean(NCOVRshp$res_fit2_lag)) / sd(NCOVRshp$res_fit2_lag)
# use Moran's I test using moran.mc() function
moran.mc(NCOVRshp$RESID_SLY, Residual_WeightMatrix, 1000, zero.policy = T)
# Moranâ€™s I in this lag model is 0.0029274, much lower than Moranâ€™s I of linear regression model (0.1301782844) and p-value = 0.3736 > 0.05

# e.g. RD90: if the levels of Resource Deprivation were to increase by 1%,
# for the direct effects in its own county, this will cause an increase in the homicide rate by 3.84% (p < 0.001)
# for the indirect affects, if the Resource Deprivation were to change across neighbouring counties, this will affect the value of our homicide rates by 1.278% (p < 0.001).

## Spatial Error Model

# and the impact is statistically significant (i.e., p-value < 0.001). 
# the AIC for the lag model is lower than both the original linear regression & error model (i.e., Error: 18643 vs LM: 18778 & Lag: 18636) 
# therefore the lag model better than the two.

# express the residuals in terms of standard deviations away from the mean. (RESID_SER)

# use Moran's I test using moran.mc() function
moran.mc(NCOVRshp$RESID_SER, Residual_WeightMatrix, 1000, zero.policy = T)
# Moranâ€™s I is -0.011235 which is negative, but Moranâ€™s I value of lag model is cloest to zero. 
# On top of that there is no evidence of spatial autocorrelation since its p-value is not significant. (p-value = 0.8262)
# Therefore, we can conclude that the spatial error model does address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals.
